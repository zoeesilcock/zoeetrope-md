# Welcome!

This is my little corner of this wonderous thing that we call the internet. I am Zoee and I have a passion for building and learning new things. The term zoeetrope is based on the term heliotrope which is used to describe plants that follow the sun, similarly this page was meant to follow me. Since there isn't much about me to follow this latest iteration of the page is a pure HTML page with no backend, no javascript, no cookies and no tracking of any kind.

## Bio
I was born in Sweden but when I was two years old my parents moved onto a small sailing boat. We took that boat down through the canals of Sweden and beyond, even crossed the north sea over to England to visit my fathers family. We settled for a while in the Netherlands and in the south of France but ultimately made it to Greece where we stayed for about five years before returning to Sweden.

## Career
My career started in postal delivery but I always had an interest in computers and computer programming. The very first things I build where in pure HTML back in the very early days of the internet. I also learned some C and built some small Mac applications. It wasn't until I started learning PHP that I really got into web development. Around 2009 I did a course on Java and object oriented programming which allowed me to change careers and I spent multiple years working with Ruby. These days most of my time is split between Javascript and C#.
