# Welcome!

This is my little corner of this wonderous thing that we call the internet. I am Zoee and I have a passion for building and learning new things. I have been into programming since a pretty young age and now split my time between web development and game development.

## Bio

I was born in Sweden but grew up in Greece with English as my first language and Greek as my second.
